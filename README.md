As a solo developer, I've crafted an enriching Islamic app that offers Quranic reading by page, juz, or verse, complete with Bangla and English translations. The app also provides features like prayer time management, insights into the Divine Names of Allah, a curated collection of Hadiths in both languages, a customizable Tasbih counter, and an efficient ayah search function. Additionally, I've implemented Hive for offline data storage, ensuring users can access their personalized Quranic content seamlessly.</b>.
